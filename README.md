This is a awesome font for special website and app
Sans forgetica is a variation of a sans-serif typeface, designed to assist students in retaining the information which they read. Back-slanted and with gaps in the letter forms, the typeface is designed to reduce legibility; it adds reading complexity to learning tasks based on the psychological principle known as desirable difficulty. Such added complexity may help learners with their reading comprehension and interpretation of information.
